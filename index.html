            <h3>WISHES</h3>
            <p>My Life Wishes & Dreams are pretty simple: I just want to become a man of my dreams who earned love, respect, wealth and health.
                At the end, I do not want to regret about my wasted potential. I want to have a loyal woman next to me, mother of my children, and a home full of love, care and respect.
                These are primary targets of mine for my future but of course beside them I have plenty other detailed goals, but I guess they are just matter of time and effort.</p>
